## Development

Code for the endpoints are generated automatically using a custom version of [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator).

The easier way to regenerate endpoints is to use the docker laucher packaged in `vendor/bin`:

```bash
./vendor/bin/elastic-codegen.sh
```

The custom generator will be build and launched using the following Open API spec file : `resources/api/api-spec.yml`.

You can then commit and PR your endpoint code and modified api-spec files.

The client class may be changed in some case. Do not forget to include it in your commit.
